# Overview

This C# program will prompt a user for information about a tower they would like to create
in a tower defense game. After the data is collected, it is presented back to the user.

I wrote this program to test my comprehension of classes and how they communicate, as 
well as how to store multiple forms of data types (strings and ints) into one data type.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
